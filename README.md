# grottaBar

A small R utility for converting the output of table() commands to a rudimentary "Grotta Bar" for stroke research.

A "Grotta Bar" is a stacked proportional bar chart, rotated to be horizontal, with lines connecting the two groups.
It is how primary outcome data is often represented in stroke research.

This utility shamelessly lifts from aosmith's answer to the following question stack overflow question:
