# grottaBar

A small R utility for converting the output of table() commands to a rudimentary "Grotta Bar" for stroke research.

A "Grotta Bar" is a stacked proportional bar chart, rotated to be horizontal, with lines connecting the two groups.
It is how primary outcome data is often represented in stroke research.
